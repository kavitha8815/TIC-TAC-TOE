# TIC-TAC TOE console based project
TIC-TAC TOE Game in Java


##TIC-TAC TOE

A console-based, two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using Core Java. The game allows players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
It includes functionality to detect winning conditions, handle draws, and ensure valid inputs. This project showcases basic programming concepts like
arrays, loops, inheritance and conditional statements in Java.It can help the newly started coders to understand easily and try with their own ideas, 
where to use the core concepts of java in real life applications.

## Features

1. 2-Player Mode: Players alternately place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
2. Console-Based Interface: Simple and intuitive text-based UI for seamless gameplay.
3. Win Condition Logic: Detects winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals) after every move.
4. Draw Scenarios: Automatically identifies and announces a draw if all grid spaces are filled without a winner.
5. Input Validation: Ensures valid moves by checking grid availability and preventing invalid inputs.
6. Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
